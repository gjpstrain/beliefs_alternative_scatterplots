\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro-main}

\section{Related Work}\label{sec-rel-work-main}

\section{General Methods}\label{sec-general-methods}

In this section we discuss our general research methods, including our
implementations of open research practices, our approach to and
justification for crowdsourcing, and our use of the ChatGPT4 LLM in
preparing parts of our stimuli.

\subsection{Open Research}\label{sec-open-research}

Both our pre and main studies were conducted according to the principles
of open and reproducible research \citep{ayris_2018}. We pre-registered
hypotheses and analysis plans with the Open Science Framework (OSF) for
the pre-study\footnote{https://osf.io/xuf4d} and the main
experiment\footnote{tbc}, and there were no deviations from them. All
data and analysis code are included in a GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/gjpstrain/beliefs\_attitudes\_atypical}.
This repository contains instructions for building a Docker container
\citep{merkel_2014} that reproduces the computational environment the
paper was written in. This allows for full replication of stimuli,
figures, analysis, and the paper itself. Ethical approval was granted by
the (removed for anon).

\subsection{Crowdsourcing}\label{crowdsourcing}

While much prior work into correlation perception in scatterplots has
taken place in person, there is precedence for work that explores
cognition to take place online using crowdsourced participants
\citep{xiong_2022}. Crowdsourcing not only affords us recruitment of
samples from across our lay population of interest, it is considerably
quicker and less expensive than in-person testing. We therefore choose
to crowdsource all participants. Previous work has reported issues of
data quality and skewed demographics
\citep{chmielewski_2020, charalambides_2021, peer_2021}, so we follow
published guidelines \citep{peer_2021} to give us the best chance of
collecting high quality data. We use the Prolific.co platform
\citep{prolific} with strict pre-screening criteria; participants were
required to have completed at least 100 studies using Prolific, and were
required to have a Prolific score of 100, representing a 99\% approval
rate.

\section{Pre-Study: Investigating Beliefs About Relatedness
Statements}\label{sec-pre-study}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec-pre-study-intro}

\subsubsection{Testing Beliefs}\label{sec-testing-beliefs}

\subsubsection{Preparation of Stimuli}\label{sec-stim-prep-pre}

Due to previous evidence suggesting effects of prior belief strength and
topic emotionality on the propensity for belief change, we first aim to
build a picture of people's thoughts and feelings along these dimensions
in our population of interest. With the intention of testing the
potential for changes in beliefs about correlations displayed in
scatterplots depicting weak and strong correlations, and those whose
topics were both strong and neutral in emotional valence, we began by
using ChatGPT4 \citep{chatgpt} to generate 100 correlation statements
using the following prompt:

\begin{center}

    ``Generate 100 statements that describe the correlation between two variables, such as :

     "X is associated with a higher level of Y" or

     "As X increases, Y increases".

    Try to match all the statements on emotionality.``
    
\end{center}

The full list of these statements can be found in the supplementary
materials. Note that we cite our use of ChatGPT according to the AI Code
of Conduct developed by Iliada Eleftheriou and Ajmal Mubarik and the
University of Manchester \citep{iliada_2023}. Two authors rated each
statement on topic emotionality and strength of correlation using Likert
scales from 1 to 7. Topic emotionality had a midpoint at 4, whereas
strength of correlation varied between 1 (Not Related At All) and 7
(Strongly Related). We calculated a quadratic weighted Cohen's Kappa
between the two raters using the \textbf{irr} package (version 0.84.1
\citep{irr}), in order to penalise larger magnitude disagreements more
harshly. We found agreement above chance for both topic emotionality
(\(\kappa\) = 0.49, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and strength of
correlation (\(\kappa\) = 0.51, \emph{p} \textless{} .001), indicating
moderate levels of agreement in both cases
\citep{cohen_1968, fleiss_1969}.

20 & Higher frequency of family meals is linked to better eating habits in children.\\
21 & As participation in community arts programs increases, local cultural engagement tends to rise.\\
22 & Higher consumption of spicy foods is associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.\\
23 & Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is linked to a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\\
24 & Higher consumption of nuts and seeds is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases.\\
\addlinespace
25 & As cultural preservation efforts increase, community identity and cohesion tend to strengthen.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

Following this, we selected strongly and weakly correlated statements
with the highest level of absolute agreement, resulting in the 14
strongly correlated statements that can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-hi} and the 11 weakly correlated statements that
can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-low}. We then tested these 25
statements with a representative UK sample in order to ascertain
consensus on both topic emotionality and strength of correlation. Doing
so allows us to effectively exclude these factors when we analyse the
effects of our atypical scatterplot designs on the propensity for belief
change in our main experiment.

\subsection{Method}\label{sec-method-pre}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{sec-participants-pre}

100 participants were recruited using the Prolific.co platform
\citep{prolific}. English fluency and residency was required for
participation, as our main experiment relied on familiarity with data
visualizations from a popular British news source. In addition to 25
experimental items, we included six attention check items, which asked
participants to provide specific answers. No participants failed more
than 2 out of 6 attention check items, and therefore data from all 100
were included in the full analysis (52.0\% male and 48.0\% female.
Participants' mean age was 41.1 (\emph{SD} = 12.3). The average time
taken to complete the survey was 7.6 minutes (\emph{SD} = 2.9 minutes).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{sec-design-pre}

Each participant saw all survey items (Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-hi} and
Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-low}), along with the six attention check items,
in a fully randomised order. All experimental code, materials, and
instructions are hosted on GitLab\footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/beliefs\_scatterplots\_pretest}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{sec-procedure-pre}

The experiment was built using Psychopy \citep{pierce_2019} and hosted
on Pavlovia.org. Participants were permitted to complete the experiment
using a phone, tablet, desktop, or laptop computer. Participants were
first shown the participant information sheet and were asked to provide
consent through key presses in response to consent statements. They were
asked to provide their age in a free text box, followed by their gender
identity. Participants were told that they would be asked to read
statements about the relatedness between a pair of variables, after
which they would have to indicate their beliefs about topic emotionality
and the strength of correlation suggested using a pair of sliders. To
familiarize themselves with the sliders, they were asked to complete a
practice round in response to the statement ``As participation in online
experiments increases, society becomes happier.''

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-results-pre}

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.4.1). We use the
\textbf{irr} package to calculate Fleiss' Kappa to measure interrater
agreement on topic emotionality and strength of correlation for the 25
experimental items. This analysis revealed that participants agreed
above chance for both topic emotionality (\(\kappa\) = 0.07, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) and strength of correlation (\(\kappa\) = 0.06,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001).

\subsection{Selecting Statements for the Main
Experiment}\label{selecting-statements-for-the-main-experiment}

To control for any potential effects of topic emotionality in the main
experiment, we first select statements that represent neutral emotional
valence. Statements with average topic emotionality ratings between 3
and 5 are statements 2, 10, 22, 16, and 23. To ascertain which
statements represent the greatest consensus, we add standard deviations
in ratings for topic emotionality and strength of correlation. Due to
concerns about experimental power, and in line with evidence that
propensity for belief change is highest when prior beliefs are not
strongly held \citep{xiong_2022}, we elected at this point to test only
the statement corresponding to weak beliefs about the strength of
correlation between the variables in question. We therefore test
statement number 22, ``Higher consumption of spicy foods is associated
with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.'', however we modify the
wording so that both variables (food consumption and cancer risk) are
positively correlated, as previous work indicates that the manipulations
we use in the atypical scatterplot condition are able to change
estimates of correlation in positively correlated scatterplots; no work
regarding the effects of these manipulations in negatively correlated
scatterplots has been completed.

\subsection{Discussion}\label{sec-discussion-pre}

Fleiss' Kappa values for interrater agreement on both topic emotionality
and strength of correlation scales are low (\(\kappa\) = 0.07 and
\(\kappa\) = 0.06 respectively), however do exceed that which would be
expected by chance. We suggest this may be due to Fleiss' Kappa not
being designed with ordinal (Likert scales in this case) data in mind.
In light of this we do not make decisions regarding which statement to
use based on the values of Fleiss' Kappa observed, but rather on the
standard deviations of ratings across all raters. Regardless, we do not
consider this to be a particular weakness, as we also test topic
emotionality and strength of correlation with participants in the main
study and include these ratings as part of our analysis.

\section{Main Study: Potential for Belief Change Using Atypical
Scatterplots}\label{sec-main-study}

We test the statement that exhibited the lowest average level of belief
about correlation, and the 2nd highest level of consensus. Modified for
directionality, this statement is therefore: ``Higher consumption of
plain (non-spicy) foods is associated with a lower risk of certain types
of cancer.''

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Defensive Confidence}\label{defensive-confidence}

In line with evidence that those who are more confident in their ability
to defend their own positions are more susceptible to having those
positions changed \citep{albarracin_2004}, we test participants'
defensive confidence using a 12-item scale. This scale is replicated
from previous work in the supplemental material, and has additionally
been utilized more recently \citep{markant_2023} to explore the
potential for attitude change specifically with regards to correlations
in scatterplots. Participants provide answers to the 12 scale items
using a 5 point Likert scale ranging from 1 (\emph{not at all
characteristic of me}) to 5 (\emph{extremely characteristic of me}).
Analysis including participants' defensive confidence scores is included
in \textbf{?@sec-additional-analyses}.

\subsection{Stimuli}\label{stimuli}

Recent work has shown that estimates of correlation can be altered when
point opacities and sizes are systematically varied in scatterplots
\citep{strain_2023, strain_2023b, strain_2024}. These manipulations have
been used in an attempt to correct for a long-standing underestimation
bias observed in correlation perception as it pertains to scatterplots.
As we now aim to test the propensity of these manipulations to affect
participants' beliefs about levels of relatedness, we choose the set of
manipulations that has previously produced the most dramatic effect on
correlation estimates; namely, the combination of typical orientation
size and opacity manipulations provided by Strain et al
\citep{strain_2024}. Here, the size and opacity of a certain scatterplot
point is lowered as a function of that point's residual error using
equation 1:

\begin{equation}
  point_{size/opacity} = 1 - b^{residual}
\end{equation}

In order to facilitate comparison to this work, we use the same protocol
to produce scatterplots for our atypical condition. This includes
creating scatterplots with 128 points, using \emph{b} = 0.25, employing
a scaling factor and constant for point size, and using an opacity floor
to ensure point visibility, as this has been an issue in previous work.
As there is evidence that people are less likely to update strongly held
beliefs following viewing scatterplot visualizations \citep[ look for
more]{markant_2023}, we selected a correlative statement that was judged
as representing weakly correlated variables. Thus, in order to induce
belief change, participants only viewed scatterplots representing
\textbf{strongly} correlated variables (0.6 \textgreater{} \emph{r}
\textgreater{} 0.99). We used \textbf{ggplot} in R to create plots that
echoed the style of a British news broadcaster and fictitiously claimed
the data to be provided by the British National Health service. Examples
of typical and atypical data-identical scatterplots can be seen in
\textbf{?@fig-main-examples}.

\subsection{Method}\label{method}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Participants were recruited using Prolific.co \citep{prolific}. English
fluency and UK residency was required for participation, as well as
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and having not participated in any
of our previous studies regarding correlation perception in scatterplots
\citep{strain}, as these represented earlier testing of the alternative
designs we employ in the atypical scatterplot condition. Data were
collected from 77 participants for each condition. 2 participants failed
more than 2 out of 4 attention check questions for each condition,
meaning their data were excluded per pre-registration stipulations. Data
from the remaining 150 participants were included in the full analysis
(48.7\% male, 48.7\% female, and 2.7\% non-binary). Participants' mean
age was 39.3 (\emph{SD} = 11.5). Participants' mean graph literacy score
was 21.3 (\emph{SD} = 4.3) out of 30. On average, participants took 14.2
minutes to complete the experiment (\emph{SD} = 6.41).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{design}

We employed a between-participants design. Each participants was
randomly assigned to either group A, in which case they viewed typical
scatterplots, or group B, in which they viewed atypical scatterplots
designed deliberately to elicit higher levels of belief change.
Participant saw all experimental items for their group, along with 4
attention check items, in a fully randomised order. All experimental
code, materials, and instructions are hosted on GitLab as two separate
experiments{[}insert{]}

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

We use PsychoPy \citep{pierce_2019} to build our experiment and
Pavlovia.org to host it. Participants were permitted to complete the
experiment on a desktop or laptop computer. We elected to prevent
participants from using a phone or tablet to complete the experiment in
line with evidence that differences in on-screen sizes of data
visualizations can alter perceptions {[}cleveland\_1982{]}. Participants
were first shown the participant information sheet and asked to provide
consent through key presses in response to consent statements. They
were, again, asked to provide their age and gender identity.
Participants then completed the 12-item Defensive Confidence scale
described by Albarracín and Mitchell \citep{albarracin_2004} and the
5-item Subjective Graph Literacy scale \citep{garcia_2016}\footnote{The
  inclusion of this scale was not specified in the pre-registration.}.
Following instructions, which included descriptions of scatterplots and
Pearson's \emph{r}. In order to give legitimacy to our data
visualizations with the hope of maximizing any potential belief change,
participants were told that the graphs were taken from a well-known
British news source, but that the identity of this source had been
obscured. In order to promote participant engagement with the
visualizations, participants were instructed to use a slider to estimate
the correlation displayed in each scatterplot; no hypotheses were made
based on these data, however they are discussed in light of recent
literature in \textbf{?@sec-correlation-ratings}. Participants then had
a chance to practice using the slider, before being asked their belief
about topic emotionality and the relatedness between variables described
in our chosen statement. Following the completion of the experimental
trials, participants were tested again on their beliefs about
relatedness, and then debriefed that the data they saw were fictional.
Interspersed among the experimental items were 4 attention check trials
which explicitly asked participants to set the slider to 0 or 1.

\subsection{Results}\label{results}

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.4.1). The
\textbf{buildmer} (version 2.11 \citep{buildmer}) and \textbf{lme4}
(version 1.1-35.3 \citep{lme4}) packages were used to build linear mixed
effects models. Semi-partial R\textsuperscript{2}, which is presented in
lieu of traditional measures of effect size, was calculated using the
\textbf{r2glmm} package (version 0.1.2 \citep{r2glmm}). To test the
first hypothesis, that ratings of strength of relatedness would be
different before and after participants viewed experimental items, we
build a model whereby the rating is predicted by the point in time the
participant made it. Our first hypothesis was supported; there was a
significant difference in ratings of strength of relatedness made before
and after participants viewed the experimental plots.

\end{table}%

A likelihood ratio test revealed that the model including time of rating
as a predictor explained significantly more variance than the null
(\(\chi^2\)(1) = 3,236.13, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).

where participants' changes in belief strength were predicted by the
scatterplot condition they were assigned to. Semi-partial
R\textsuperscript{2}, which is presented in lieu of traditional measures
of effect size, was calculated using the \textbf{r2glmm} package
(version 0.1.2 \citep{r2glmm}).
