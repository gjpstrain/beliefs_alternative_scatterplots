\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro-main}

\section{Related Work}\label{sec-rel-work-main}

\section{General Methods}\label{sec-general-methods}

In this section we discuss our general research methods, including our
implementations of open research practices, our approach to and
justification for crowdsourcing, and our approach to stimulus
generation.

\subsection{Open Research}\label{sec-open-research}

Both our pre and main studies were conducted according to the principles
of open and reproducible research \citep{ayris_2018}. We pre-registered
hypotheses and analysis plans with the Open Science Framework (OSF) for
the pre-study\footnote{https://osf.io/xuf4d} and the main
experiment\footnote{tbc}, and there were no deviations from them. All
data and analysis code are included in a GitHub repository\footnote{https://github.com/gjpstrain/beliefs\_attitudes\_atypic}.
This repository contains instructions for building a Docker container
\citep{merkel_2014} that reproduces the computational environment the
paper was written in. This allows for full replication of stimuli,
figures, analysis, and the paper itself. Ethical approval was granted
the (removed for anon).

\section{Pre-Study: Investigating Beliefs About Relatedness
Statements}\label{sec-pre-study}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{sec-pre-study-intro}

\subsubsection{Testing Beliefs}\label{sec-testing-beliefs}

\subsubsection{Preparation of Stimuli}\label{sec-stim-prep-pre}

Due to previous evidence suggesting effects of prior belief strength and
topic emotionality on the propensity for belief change, we first aim to
build a picture of people's thoughts and feelings along these dimensions
in our population of interest. With the intention of testing the
potential for changes in beliefs about correlations displayed in
scatterplots depicting weak and strong correlations, and those whose
topics were both strong and neutral in emotional valence, we began by
using ChatGPT4 \citep{chatgpt} to generate 100 correlation statements
using the following prompt:

\begin{center}

    ``Generate 100 statements that describe the correlation between two variables, such as :

     "X is associated with a higher level of Y" or

     "As X increases, Y increases".

    Try to match all the statements on emotionality.``
    
\end{center}

The full list of these statements can be found in the supplementary
materials. Note that we cite our use of ChatGPT according to the AI Code
of Conduct developed by Iliada Eleftheriou and Ajmal Mubarik and the
University of Manchester \citep{iliada_2023}. Two authors rated each
statement on topic emotionality and strength of correlation using Likert
scales from 1 to 7. Topic emotionality had a midpoint at 4, whereas
strength of correlation varied between 1 (Not Related At All) and 7
(Strongly Related). We calculated a quadratic weighted Cohen's Kappa
between the two raters using the \textbf{irr} package (version
0.84.1\citep{irr}), in order to penalise larger magnitude disagreements
more harshly. We found agreement above chance for both topic
emotionality (\(\kappa\) = 0.49, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and strength
of correlation (\(\kappa\) = 0.51, \emph{p} \textless{} .001),
indicating moderate levels of agreement in both cases
\citep{cohen_1968, fleiss_1969}.

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tbl-pre-test-hi}Pre-test statements that were rated as
being strongly correlated.}

\begin{tabular}[t]{rl}

being weakly correlated.}

\centering{

\begin{tabular}[t]{rl}
\toprule
Item Number & Statement - Weak Correlation Depicted\\
\midrule
15 & Greater water consumption is linked to improved kidney function.\\
16 & As the amount of sleep decreases, the risk of obesity increases.\\
17 & Greater intake of omega-3 fatty acids is associated with lower inflammation levels.\\
18 & Greater exposure to music education is linked to enhanced cognitive development in children.\\
19 & Higher exposure to air conditioning is associated with increased respiratory issues.\\
\addlinespace
20 & Higher frequency of family meals is linked to better eating habits in children.\\
21 & As participation in community arts programs increases, local cultural engagement tends to rise.\\
22 & Higher consumption of spicy foods is associated with a lower risk of certain types of cancer.\\
23 & Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is linked to a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\\
24 & Higher consumption of nuts and seeds is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases.\\
\addlinespace
25 & As cultural preservation efforts increase, community identity and cohesion tend to strengthen.\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}

}

\end{table}%

Following this, we selected strongly and weakly correlated statements
with the highest level of absolute agreement, resulting in the 14
strongly correlated statements that can be seen in
Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-hi} and the 11 weakly correlated statements that
can be seen in Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-low}. As we only needed two
statements for each of the high and low correlation conditions in our
main experiment, we elected to test these 25 statements with a
representative UK sample in order to ascertain consensus on both topic
emotionality and strength of correlation. Doing so allows us to
effectively exclude these factors when we analyse the effects of our
atypical scatterplot designs on the propensity for belief change in our
main experiment.

\subsection{Method}\label{sec-method-pre}

\subsubsection{Participants}\label{sec-participants-pre}

100 participants were recruited using the Prolific.co platform
\citep{prolific}. English fluency and residency was required for
participation, as our main experiment relied on familiarity with data
visualisations from a popular British news source. In addition to 25
experimental items, we included six attention check items, which asked
participants to provide specific answers. No participants failed more
than 2 out of 6 attention check items, and therefore data from all 100
were included in the full analysis (52.0\% male and 48.0\% female.
Participants' mean age was 41.1 (\emph{SD} = 12.3). The average time
taken to complete the survey was 7.6 minutes (\emph{SD} = 2.9 minutes).

\subsubsection{Design}\label{sec-design-pre}

Each participant saw all survey items (Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-hi} and
Table~\ref{tbl-pre-test-low}), along with the six attention check items,
in a fully randomised order. All experimental code, materials, and
instructions are hosted on GitLab\footnote{https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/Strain/beliefs\_scatterplots\_pretest}.

\subsubsection{Procedure}\label{sec-procedure-pre}

The experiment was built using Psychopy \citep{pierce_2019} and hosted
on Pavlovia.org. Participants were permitted to complete the experiment
using a phone, tablet, desktop, or laptop computer. Participants were
first shown the participant information sheet and were asked to provide
consent through key presses in response to consent statements. They were
asked to provide their age in a free text box, followed by their gender
identity. Participants were told that they would be asked to read
statements about the relatedness between a pair of variables, after
which they would have to indicate their beliefs about topic emotionality
and the strength of correlation suggested. To familiarize themselves
with the slider, they were asked to complete a practice round in
response to the statement ``As participation in online experiments
increases, society becomes happier.''

\subsection{Results}\label{sec-results-pre}

All analyses were conducted using R (version 4.4.0). We use the
\textbf{irr} package to calculate Fleiss' Kappa to measure interrater
agreement on topic emotionality and strength of correlation for the 25
experimental items. This analysis revealed that participants agreed
above chance for both topic emotionality (\(\kappa\) = 0.07, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001) and strength of correlation (\(\kappa\) = 0.06,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001).

\subsection{Selecting Statements for the Main
Experiment}\label{selecting-statements-for-the-main-experiment}

To control for any potential effects of topic emotionality in the main
experiment, we first select statements that represent neutral emotional
valence. Statements with average topic emotionality ratings between 3
and 5 are statements 2, 10, 22, 16, and 23. To ascertain which
statements represent the greatest consensus, we add standard deviations
in ratings for topic emotionality and strength of correlation, then take
the statement from each of the high and low correlation lists with the
lowest summed standard deviation, which in this case is statements 2,
and 22.
